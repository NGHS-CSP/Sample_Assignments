    "Create a 'pokemon' turn base game where you have 2 characters that are fighting against each other. Your game should include character selection, an automated computer component, an ability to select between different attack or healing options every turn, and a game that automatically ends when one of the player's health points drops down to or below 0. Additional challenges include, including different types of monsters (fire, water, earth) where certain types are more effective/less effective against other types (i.e. water monster attacks are 15% more effective against fire monsters), having a team of monsters fight against another team of monsters, create a multiplayer mode where you can play against a second person."
